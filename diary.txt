Today is my first day as a private investigator for “History Unfolded”.

The contract has been signed and all the terms agreed for. But I am still shocked about how smooth that went. Those people … the “handler” - they didn't even ask that many questions. It seemed like they knew me for quite some time. And that Aurana chick … stunning but dangerous. She gives me chills.

How did I even get here … have been asking that myself for several days now. Guess wanting something new and mysterious can sometimes lead to such adventures.

The main goal of that “contract” is to uncover some old mysteries it seems. But I wonder if those are truly a secret for the people who hired me, because they seem to be very well informed. Like having deep knowledge on most events.

Maybe they are looking for an alternative opinion, or maybe they found something interesting in my personality and skill set … Honestly, I am not sure I would even like to know.

For me this is an opportunity to show myself. This “PI” stuff thrills me. Besides, from a rough description of events that I would be looking at, it seems that those are the pretty big ones. I wonder why I have not heard about them before.

After all, the Handler said that "they think it's all connected", a classical conspiracy theory that looks too good to be true. I honestly would have not believed anything she said, if not for her look. She did not look like a crazy person but rather a cold and dedicated one. Ex-military i would say, if not something more serious.

But all things considered, I have no clue whom I am working for. That company is just a shell, that much is obvious, but who they really are … should I even care? After all, that contract came through an CORIE job center, so it's official and approved. That's some reassurance at least.

I need to stay sharp though, as this is my first time working with those people and I honestly start to think that it all might be just a test of my skills.

I've shared some thoughts with a few of my old friends from the "good old days" and they all said that I probably should not do it. Well, got nothing better to do, so why not.

The only thing that really concerns me is the contract - it is too vague and even the money that they told me about is not stated. That is really weird. Let's hope those guys will keep their word on all the terms and conditions we spoke about. Somehow I believe they will.

Maybe this is finally something I was looking for, and maybe that contract will change my life for the better … for once.
