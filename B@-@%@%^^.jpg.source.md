# CLASSIFIED OPERATION REPORT

Assessment ID: CT1702, DTJC v3 couplings test - Extended

## Extended Report
We have received a fresh batch of new couplings. Our task is to test them out on our existing models.

### COMPLETE TEST RESULTS
* Test 1 - Spin rate: 15% increase
* Test 2 - Angular strike stress: 7% increase
* Test 3 - Electrical compatibility: Severe degradation
* Test 6 - Material scan (TOP SECRET): Traces of high energy particles
* Test 7 - System Integration (TOP SECRET): Attempts to integrate couplings failed

For _deeper_ analysis, see classified section.

### ADDITION - TOP SECRET
The summary of all that information is that those couplings were modified by someone, likely SOYUZ "razvedka" service.
