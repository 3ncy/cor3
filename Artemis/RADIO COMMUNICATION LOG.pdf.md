TRANSCRIPT: RECOVERED RADIO COMMUNICATION LOG
Status: Compiled from two partial audio extracts

Integrity: 41% (estimated)

Note: Timecodes removed — inconsistent.

[SECTION 1: EVACUATION LOG — AUDIO TRANSCRIPT]
Condition: Fragmentary, clipped.

SIMON: Get those crates on the shuttle. You have to get them to the station. Start low and then make a fast climb — we still don’t know where those bastards shoot from. Avoid the mountains.

PILOT: This is insane. I need a flight plan! Navigational charts! Something! There's a sandstorm tearing the sky apart — how am I supposed to fly through this?

SIMON: This is our only chance. Take the cargo and go. If you reach the stratosphere, others will follow. We have two more VTOLs waiting. Come on, man... you know we can’t stay here any longer — and you're our best pilot.

PILOT: ...Bloody hell. One last time, Simon. Let’s do it. One last time.

[SECTION 2: COMMS-CHECK — RADIO TRANSCRIPT]
Channel: EMCOM Emergency Frequency

Condition: Heavily corrupted — intermittent static.

SIMON: This is CORE—[STATIC]—outpost calling on EMCOM frequency. Anyone out there, please respond. Over.

[STATIC — CONTINUES]

SIMON: This is—[STATIC]—Outpost—[STATIC]reaching on EMCOM frequency. Please respond, over.

PILOT: Simon, no one is answering. Stop it, you’ll uncover our location. We have to seal the complex. That pilot... he’s long gone.

SIMON: You don't know that. He might still be out there. Fucking storm… fucking terraformers...

PILOT: Let it go. Let’s get back inside. Waiting is all we’ve got left. And praying… though I know you don’t care much for that part.

SIMON: Yeah. As if praying would help now. ...Fuck it. Let’s go inside.
