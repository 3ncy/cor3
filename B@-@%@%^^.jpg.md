**Assessment ID:** DTJC v3 couplings test

**Lead Investigator:** Simon Webb

**Date:** 2251.03.20

**Classification:** RESTRICTED

**Initial Report:**

"We have received a fresh batch of new couplings, the ones CORE Tech designed to be<br>
used in "unmanned bipedal units". Our task is to test them out on our existing models, before implementing them<br>
across upcoming product lines."

Although I have no reason to be cautious about any products that we receive from<br>
CORE, these couplings look somewhat different and too much like a prototype. We would have to run extensive<br>
tests on them, without analysing the composites themselves, which is prohibited under the terms of the license.<br>

Also, the shipment container that those came in shows exten* sive wear and delivery<br>
information for one of the SOYUZ testing sites. Was that a mistake?"

### TEST RESULTS
* Test 1 - Spin rate: 15% increase in rotation speed without excessive<br>
    degradation
* Test 2 - Angular strike stress: 7% increase in durability<br>
* Test 3 - Electrical compatibility: Severe degradation in whole system<br>
    operation. Reason unknown
* Test 4 - Environmental resistance: Extended resistance to corrosive<br>
    environments
* Test 5 - Magnetic properties: Inconsistent results

**Investigator's Notes:**

"The results of these tests are remarkable, almost magical. I know it's not a<br>
scientific description but I have never seen a material like that. Its color, physical properties and the way it<br>
interacts with other parts … a mystery. We were not able to determine the magnetic properties of those couplings<br>
at all - impossible results, like that’s a material from a star."

These mystical properties lead to the next problem - compatibility. Drone "health"<br>
systems cannot properly determine the status of these couplings, therefore a "critical damage" status lights up<br>
and shuts the whole system down. Besides, our techs say that they affect the electrical grid as well, even if<br>
it's insulated.

All things considered, I am inclined to think that those couplings were never<br>
designed for use in any type of drone or bot at all. I am no expert but it's probably a stealth tech of some<br>
sort. I will contact the higher ups to process all that information and make some … decisions. Meanwhile all our<br>
personnel have been told to keep quiet about it. We do not want some international "incident" or SOYUZ troops<br>
storming our facility."
