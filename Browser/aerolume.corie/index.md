# AEROLUME
*Bringing the breath back to breathing.*

**When was the last time you really breathed?**

Not recycled, filtered and processed air. Living air, air that feels alive?

> Every breath should connect you back to the essence of being human, no matter where you are. This was the core principle in the development of the Aerolume Air Vitalization System (AVS), a revolutionary and portable air harmonizer that elevates your atmosphere.

## 1. How it works
The AVS infuses your breathing environment with balanced energy fields that replicate the ionic structure of natural home planet air. Using multi-stage harmonics and reactive oxygen modulation yields clinically proven results.

* Static fatigue and cognitive haze in recycled environments is reduced up to 67%
* Oxygen ionization increases calmness levels by at least 20%
* Clinical trials also reported a restoration of an intangible "home frequency" in the living spaces

The system requires custom structural calibration, available from our wide network of community partners. Every partner helps us spread our mission of restoring air to human life.
