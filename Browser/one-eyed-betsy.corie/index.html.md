Bionics and Bodyworks — Betsy MrAllen

## Bionics and Bodyworks

You don't last long out here without getting some scratches or losing something, maybe an arm or a limb, or something you don't talk about. Down here at One-Eyed-Betsy don't judge what you lost, just help you get it back even stronger.

Come on down and meet Betsy MrAllen herself, you all know her well. Our lil corner of the station has become a lifeline for anyone with a bad day or a worse explosion. Maybe even the best day for someone looking to get a particular inclination actualized. People say a lot of things, but no one ever said they didn't leave here a satisfied customer. Walk out our door with all your bits and bobs in the desired place, humming sweeter than before, that's what counts.

## The Betsy Standard

Practical work and no stitching. Our shop has helped rebuild miners, mercenaries, pilots and unfortunate civilians. We work on removals, additions, recalibrations and any body work that's been known to us, and anything we can learn easy enough.

**We specialize in prosthetics, implants, cybernetic enhancements and modifications, both functional and aesthetic, rarely both at the same time.**


## New in

Our newest addition is the Auto-Mod systems we had installed. The next generation, automated installation booths can scan and calibrate and install compatible upgrades in a fraction of the time it used to take. The machines can do state of the art on-the-spot prosthetic and fitting adjustments as well as the manufacturing, if you can design it. This means shorter waiting times and surgery durations.
