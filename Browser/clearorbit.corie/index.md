Services include but are not limited to:

Decluttering and sorting

## The ClearOrbit choice
Clark Orbit started this service as a way to assist in renewing and refreshing what were becoming degraded living spaces. Clark saw it for what it was, an echo of the world before, inherited objects, habitats, noise.


**Now ClearOrbit's small team of organizers are available around most major orbital stations and colonies, available for on-site or remote consultation.**
