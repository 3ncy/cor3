### "Farsight" CCS Meeting
ARC ID 11.3 PUBLIC

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Terra, 2092</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Partially declassified document</p><br>
<p>"My fellow comrades, we have gathered here to discuss a task that would lay upon our shoulders in the nearest future. Most of you know that the discovery of the Island has happened. We are yet to fully explore it and uncover its mysteries, but one thing is clear - this would bring us a step closer to our ultimate goal.</p>
<p>We, in the Core Colonial Structure must be ready to lead humanity forward, to the stars and new planets. Our task is to be the first ones everywhere. To lead the way for the upcoming wave. You all understand the risks, and you all have taken vows to guide humanity to their survival.</p>
<p>Only you know all the truth, and it should stay that way forever. Be brave, as the light of knowledge will always guide us."</p>

### Global presentation of the NIC ® Technology ©
ARC ID 124.6 PUBLIC

<p><strong>Location:</strong> The Island, Feb 2nd, 2100</p>
<p><strong>Spokesperson:</strong> Magnus Vervortessen, CORE Tech, Ring 5 Overseer</p><br>
<p>"Today, I am honored to present you with something truly great - a technology that would advance the development of humanity one step up and open our road to a brighter future. I present to you - The NIC."</p>
<p>Near-infinite-capacitors, or NIC, are a byproduct technology of CORE's NullT energy transfer tech, that remains classified up to this day. It is an energy storage technology that relies on specific high density materials being tempered with advanced magnetic fields together with the application of high energies.</p>
<p>The result is somewhat "magical" - materials that are super dense yet very light. The implementation of that technology into common life allowed it to mostly replace fossil fuels and other "classical" energy sources, transferring most machinery to electricity powered engines.</p>
<p>Yet, the earlier practical implementations of that technology had its flaws. The batteries that were produced in the early days of the "electric boom" were somewhat unstable. If tampered with, they could explode, producing an explosion with the force up to 1 ton of TnT on bigger batteries.</p>
<p>There have been several accidents in that regard, one of which happened with an unnamed colony ship that was later lost in deep space due to total blackout.</p>
<p>Different radical groups have used those batteries with ill intent as well, resulting in so called "terrorist attacks" that happened up to 2110, after which the CORE took full control of ALL production facilities, tightening security and refining the technology itself.</p>
<p>Older versions of the batteries can still be found on some remote stations, or asteroids, or even inside older vehicles and equipment and have become a commodity of a sort.</p>
<p>Some technicians and engineers say that the earlier versions of the batteries have much better output and density (probably due to different materials) and are willing to risk their unstable nature for the upgraded performance.</p>
<p>Today the NIC batteries are produced in all form factors, and are used in ALL electrical equipment, both civilian and military.</p>

### Merger Vote

ARC ID 2512.4 PUBLIC

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Luna, Exar-Solis HQ, 2105</p><br>
<p>"All those against the merger - raise your hands"</p>
<p>"All those FOR the merger - raise your hands"</p>
<p>"Approved, Unanimously. Congratulations, gentleman".</p>
<p>United Solar, or USOL is an alliance of corporations from all over the old world, mostly presented by the "old timers" like Big Tech and Energy complex companies.</p>
<p>When the winds of change started to blow, those companies, under the leadership of Exar-Solis, agreed to merge into a giant conglomerate to accumulate profits.</p>
<p>The ideals of USOL could be shortly described as "maximum profit". Having their main HQ on Luna, USOL has several major outposts around the solar system. Yet they mostly rely on space trade stations, tending to create big trade hubs for inter-system commerce.</p>
<p>Yet even after the merger, the group is always dragged in different directions by inner warring sub factions that are always competing for resources and power. This gives USOL a technological advantage over other factions (except CORE) but does not really allow it to get strong enough to take them over.</p>
<p>Having "survival of the fittest" as one of the key principles of community, USOL is despised by SOYUZ, which leads to different tensions, provoking conflicts over space and resources.</p>
<p>Nowadays (2251) as one of the main political factions, USOL also has a seat on the Perpetual Council which prevents open conflict.</p>

### Project Adonis
ARC ID 3125.2 PUBLIC

<p><strong>Source:</strong> "Oh Life" magazine, Terra, 2150</p>
<p><strong>Article by:</strong> Professor J.M. Blake</p><br>
<p>"Among several planets chosen for colonization, Mars has always been a priority. Its relative closeness to Terra meant that the amount of required resources for the project would be lesser than any other option (aside from other reasons). Several attempts to scout the planet have been made throughout the early 2100's. The results of geological scans came promising, and several generational ships have been launched towards the planet by various entities.</p>
<p>The first ship was named "Mars Uno" and contained early cryo-capsules with the volunteer colonists, including people from different religious movements that were planning to start a search for God on the new planet.</p>
<p>Their goal was to "resurrect" the "Red planet" in the hope that after being terraformed, it would provide a habitable ecosystem close to the old home.</p>
<p>Instead, a disaster happened, which led to the ship crash landing on the planet, killing thousands of sleeping colonists.</p>
<p>The surviving crew and colonists salvaged the ship for all usable resources, and had to hold on till the next wave of ships arrived to help them a few years later.</p>
<p>New colonists coming to the planet found a hardened and united community of survivors that had been self-sustaining and even started to grow. Truly a miracle, in the eyes of many, yet none of the initial survivors were willing to ever talk about the cost of it.</p>
<p>The events that the first colonies endured had forever segregated them from any and all others, who came later, forming a base for contempt between the planet's population.</p>
<p>The scientific community together with political governments are looking for a solution to the problem, but have not found it up to this day.</p>
<p>CORE security forces together with USOL administration are trying to keep peace at the colony, yet Planetary Coordinator Santiago Silva is not convinced that it will remain peaceful for much longer"</p>

### "Firecracker". Perpetual Council Session
ARC ID 8816.5 PUBLIC

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Session #2 on June 23 2205</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Archival transcript</p><br>
<p><strong>Representatives present:</strong></p>

* Sir William Consworth, USOL
* Colonel Solomon Zhao, SOYUZ
* Arbiter Demeter Muggabee, Terra Mater.

<p><strong>Presiding:</strong> Ring 7, Mister J. S. Comtor, CADL.</p><br>
<p><strong>Mr Comtor:</strong> Gentleman, we have adjourned here today to discuss events that have occurred on the "Horizon" drilling platform, located in the asteroid belt. I know there has been some miscommunication between council members in regards to that station, but from our perspective it was built by a private company not affiliated with any political power. I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Muggabee:</strong> Terra Mater would abstain this time, we have nothing to do with that. In fact I wonder why you would even call me here, I have other more important things to attend to.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Comtor:</strong> Demeter, I know you are busy, we all are, but I called you here today to listen. Maybe you will find something useful here. Mister Zhao, if you may, please?</p>
<p><strong>Mr Zhao:</strong> Of course, Mister Comtor. First of all, I would like to say that SOYUZ had nothing to do with the initial incident. As far as we are concerned the station came under attack by some mercenary units, operating under no or false flag. As soon as the station signaled SoS on open channel, our patrol fleet that was passing nearby changed course to assist. The efficiency of our Abordazhnik crews are well known, so after a short firefight there were no hostiles left. Sadly, due to the weapons used, the identification of the corpses was not possible, so our personnel, together with the remaining station crew and occupants got rid of the remains. After that our crew left the station. The upcoming vote to join SOYUZ unanimously was procured by station residents on their free will without any of our personnel present.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Consworth:</strong> This is just laughable. Did you really think that ANYONE would believe such a story? I guess you forgot to mention that 1 week prior to that "incident" the station was planning to sign a long term contract with us for selling their mined resources, and was supposed to become a very profitable trade hub.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Zhao:</strong> I have no such information. But anyway, as far as I was told, your patrol fleet was not that far from the area as well, do they confirm my words on timeline?</p>
<p><strong>Sir Consworth:</strong> They do, but claim you left after the vote was done, not before that. More to say, they have sent shuttlecraft to the station after the event and those reported the population was scared to death, with trembling hands and in shock. After the so-called vote. So we call it a ruse, at best.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Zhao:</strong> I have not read any proof of your accusations yet, so please provide them or stop throwing out those empty words…</p>
<p><strong>Sir Consworth:</strong> We both know that 2 weeks prior several SOYUZ militia units went rogue not far away from the area. I have no doubt that you have killed your men yourself and got rid of the bodies. That you know how to do.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Zhao:</strong> this is… unacceptable. I would ask Mister Comtor to protect me from such unsupported accusations.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Comtor:</strong> Yes, yes, of course. Although what interests me is that how come both of your fleets have been in the area straight after our cargo convoy has brought strategic assets for a further transportation and left shortly after? And how come the locals, under interrogation, said that those "attackers" were fighting each other as well? Would you kindly answer that? Oh, and Mister Muggabee… only you and your command knew about that convoy, because it came from Terra.</p>
<p><strong>(silence)...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr Comtor:</strong> I see. Let us close this topic, for now, and come to some conclusions on our own. After all, nothing of value was lost, and all CORE assets are with us. I hope it was worth it. Good luck gentlemen.</p>
