## Introduction

"Island" — lunar megastructure on the dark side, arising from events of 1986 ("Incident"). Initial inspection recorded hull deformations, shut‑down reactors, and absence of population. Over the following decade, the object was reclaimed, partially restored, and used by CORE as a base and headquarters.

Based on collected materials, "Island" became a key node for *Null‑T* (instant transfer) and *NIC* (ultra‑high capacity storage) technologies. Full specifications are classified; only general principles are disclosed.

## Megastructure Zones

### Green Ring
**Description** — Outer perimeter with minimal damage. Small residential development; open areas for domes and services.

**Dating** — Pre‑1986; being clarified.

**Objects** — Fragments of residential blocks, service platforms, post‑reclamation infrastructure.

*Slot A · ≥ 1400×700*

### Middle Rim
**Description** — Industrial‑research belt with R&D buildings and workshops; part of capacity restored.

**Energy** — Reactor R‑1 located and modernized during reclamation period.

**Objects** — R&D buildings, workshops, power units, transport galleries.

### Shadow Zone
**Description** — Experiment epicenter (~2 km²), maximum distortions and destruction.

**Energy** — Reactor R‑2 sustained damage; enhanced security regime in effect.

**Access Status** — Key personnel only; part of data edited.

## Reclamation History
|  |  |
|-|-|
|**Pre‑1986** |  **Object Formation.** Soviet scientific‑industrial complex (Arkhangelsk‑14) with deep laboratories and production. ||
| **1986** | **"Incident."** Zero mass prototype activation → spatial displacement of complex; discovered on dark side of Moon. |
| **Late XX — XXI** | **Discovery and Concealment.** Anomaly recorded in private mapping; reclamation begins under cover of “lunar base”. |
| **≈ 10 years** | **Full Reclamation.** "Island" becomes active base and CORE headquarters; reactors restarted, domes erected. |
| **2100+** | **New Expansion.** Null‑T and NIC launch growth of stations and colonies; "Island" — key node. |
| **2230+** | **Infrastructure Degradation.** General deterioration of communications and supply; "Island" maintains support status with limited resources. |
| **2250** | **Present.** Stable‑tense operating mode; research in "shadow zone" continues. |

## Infrastructure and Status

- **Energy** — Two reactors: R‑1 (middle rim, operational after modernization), R‑2 (shadow zone, damaged; limited access regime).
- **Domes/Modules** — Dome structures and restored workshops provide production and life support.
- **Null‑T / NIC** — Basic logistics and energy; specifications closed.
- **Strategic Notes** — Object is critically important; defense details not disclosed.
