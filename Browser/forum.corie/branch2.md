Gents, is there a proper way to contact someone in a messenger with only an employee account at hand ?

no, unless they specifically reveal some information. Might be a messenger ID or something like that. You can always try searching the CORIE web, but those corp fuckers like to use <strong>aliases</strong> for some reason as well btw.

Pray luck to be on your side m8.

I've got a dumb question - how do I open the folders on a remote pc ? I think I was granted access by my employer but I can't do it somehow.

dude … double click ? 😄 What's the problem, are they encrypted or something ?

yeah yeah, encrypted. I think the employer forgot to give me a proper password. The one I have is not working.

Huh. Yeah no m8, go ask somewhere else. We are not looking for trouble here. You know what you are asking, I'm sure. Maybe someone will message you directly, if you leave your contacts here, you know …

we don't know who he was, for sure. Might be Council guys, or some corporate, or even CIS.

Definitely not CIS. Those guys never do such stupid stuff. But yeah, that one probably was a newbie trying to find easy targets to promote himself. We get those every month basically.

Speaking of newbies. I am one, and I'm not an agent. And I need help guys - got a site that's not opening properly. I think there are several like these on the web till recently. Does anyone know what can be done to fully access those ?

Could you please at least give us a hint about what's going on there ? We can't really read minds, you know ;-)

Sorry, sorry. So that site just has some articles I would like to read, but it just does not load several pages, for no specific reason. I was thinking maybe someone is attacking it and it's the system fighting but does not look like it.

There are several options, depending on what's really going on with that. Totally legit options so i can advise you :

- Check your connection. Although the fact that you post here says it's fine
- Try using a proxy. As we all know the rich guys use <strong>Lunar proxy</strong>, so if you have it - you'll be fine. Opens up additional options as well btw.
- Try opening site code and checking what's up, in case you can read that code ofc.
- Try using <strong>connect_site --token=[place token here]</strong> for connection. Use CORIE built in console ofc. No promises that it will work, but nothing more "legal" than that. If everything does not work - ask around for advice.

Sometimes no is a no though.

typing sudo doesn’t do anything. why even include it if permissions don’t exist here?
