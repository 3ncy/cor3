Hi everyone. Could you guys please help me with something ? I have been monitoring the radio wavelength for a few weeks and started to find some weird records broadcasted into the emptiness of space, for no specific reason. Does anyone know what it's all about ?

I'm definitely not giving out my location. As for everything else - I have heard weird chants, then some traffic messages, then some crazy propaganda as well. I'v heard once that a person was praising a planet as a living entity, although i didnt get which one.

if you think that it's really weird then might as well report those to authorities (if they don't know already). You'd never know what you find in space, could be something important enough to get a reward. Or get your ass kicked for spoiling a secret. Up to you man.

So reassuring 😄 But yeah, thank you. Will do. It makes much more sense then wasting my time on that.
