DUDES !!!!! Check this out - I've found a new shooter that just came out ! It's like our real life but in the past AND future. The player changes timelines !

The name of the shooter is Galactic Escape ! Has anyone played that yet ? Looking for a party !

Some, by people who played. Mostly positive. Although many talk about the game being too hard and not forgiving. Like it makes you suffer. My experience so far has not been like that but i'm in only for like 3 hours.

You can get it on CORIE.Games. I think it's on sale btw.

Guys, I know the game. Or let's say I have played several ones from the same developer. Trust me, there will be pain and will be suffering. You will eat shit. But that's just part of the process. You will get better and own everyone. And that's like a drug. Or not, and then you will curse the day you found it. Variety of emotions guaranteed. Enjoy 😀

I'm starting to have second thoughts. But anyways, it's not my style to drop out that early, so I'll try my best.
