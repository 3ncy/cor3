People, has anyone seen this new Council ad ? Is it true or just another meme from <strong>team weirdhack</strong> ?

I have seen it. Can't say if its real or not, but considering that Council is trying to bite more than they can chew - would not surprise me at all. There were rumors that they have been forming a cybersecurity team to be 'independent'. I guess someone in the management team decided that they can become something 'real' instead of corporate puppets.

I didnt think it was that serious, but yeah, you might be right. I'd probably check it out and see what happens. Have been looking for a job for quite a while anyways.

Keep us posted, but, as a friendly reminder, corporate or government officials are prohibited from here. If you choose that path I will have to block your access. We will miss you 🙂

Dont block it yet please. Might be a scam anyways and then you guys would be the first to know and laugh it off with me. But yeah, friends are friends, even if our roads separate.
