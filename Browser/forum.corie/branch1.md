Hey guys. I was checking out that site about some exhibitions when I noticed it's somewhat half-operational. Most of the site is somehow inaccessible, and it looks like these parts were not planned to be accessible in the first place.

Has anyone seen it ? Here's the -url-. Maybe you guys can find something interesting.

Huh, I mean, it's a site about the recent event on <strong>Smuglianka</strong> station, an agricultural station, the site is just probably poorly maintained or some local admin just fucked things up. I doubt there's much to be found.

Guys, as a theory - maybe someone added something to that site that was not supposed to be there entirely, and now the system is trying to load it …

Dude, we all love that crap here, but you are too delusional. I mean, if you really want you can ask tech guys around here but i'd doubt that you'll find anything of value … like i said.

Well yeah, I was looking through files they have there and it's basically all about some plants they grow and experiments they make. Looks like all legit stuff. Probably not worthy of your time gents, sorry for bothering.

Gents, it's just the usual thing. Admins just forgot to update the content. There's clearly some stuff 'behind the doors' but I doubt it's worth it. But reading about genetically modified cabbage-carrots is always fun 😊 I'll close this topic in a day or two.

someone  said that AstroCorp backend still runs on CORIE v1.0. that’s like elder era tech. no wonder it lags.

check this → [astrocorp.corie:8020/plant_stream](/Browser/astrocorp.corie/plant_stream.md) it used to stream greenhouse cameras 24/7

Maybe they just moved the archive. Try [astrocorp.corie/archive_root.bak](/Browser/astrocorp.corie/archive_root.bak)

yeah right, next you’ll tell me there’s a secret radio signal embedded in their CSS 😆

tbh half of corporate sites behave like that these days. I once saw [biofuse.corie](/Browser/biofuse.corie) link in another archive

tried pinging astrocorp.corie — latency spikes like crazy. either the node’s overloaded or someone’s poking it from inside.

ok, folks, keep it civil. we’re not turning this into another “hidden files” thread.

guys stop digging. it’s just another agro-site. there’s no secret bunker full of mutant potatoes, calm down 😆

Tried opening it  — just blank white page. 10/10 UX design.

stop refreshing it every 5 minutes expecting ARG crap. it’s just plants and bad CSS.
