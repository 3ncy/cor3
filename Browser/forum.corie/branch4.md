Guys, me and my team have been hiking recently and took some MRE's with us. Everyone got sick from that crap. But ! It was like we were on drugs. Super charged, super energized. Does anyone know wtf is going on ?

heard several stories like that too. People talk about random foods hitting the market with questionable quality. I'v heard there were several investigations from different agencies, including private ones. Most claim that all that crap comes from the same location, wherever that may be. I have not heard anyone coming to a final conclusion or having solid proof. So just be careful out there man.

Holy shit man ! Good to know, I will try to stay away from that. Any specifics on what products may be affected ? We got our MRE's from a "<strong>help the locals</strong>" program. I don't even know who runs that, but they were super polite. But they kinda extracted as soon as all the hand outs were distributed.

Only a rumor - <strong>CDEA</strong>. Bad people. If you see them again - run. Or call the Council forces and then run. Don't try your luck. Besides, considering you survived this … watch your back man, at least for a while.
