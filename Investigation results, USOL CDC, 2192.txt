Investigation results, USOL CDC,  2192.

After carefully examining all the information we have come to a conclusion that the “catastrophic event” had a human-made nature. We believe that the event was instigated by a terrorist cell known as PCF with the help from the outside.  

Our inquiry shows that the firefight was instigated by protestors that captured several USOL members, therefore giving the enforcer team no option but to engage with their weapons.  

The Following explosion and damages are considered as a terrorist attack using unknown explosive devices. 

Since the target area is out of reach, no further possible inquiry is available.  

Recommend physical action on any and all involved and affiliated PCF members.



USOL CDC, Colonel Kirch.
